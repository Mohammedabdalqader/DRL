# Continuous Control

While working on this project, I had to invest too much time in research to find the right algorithms for such a problem. There were many options available to me, and this was a challenge for me, and from here my journey began.

There is really a very useful [repo](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL) that describes and implements different algorithms that work very well for such a problem with continuous action space. Thanks to this repo and other sources, I was able to understand some algorithms correctly, including the DDPG, D4PG, PPO, A2C, and A3C algorithms, and I was able to implement some of these algorithms to solve my problem.

In this report I will explain everything about this project in details. So we will look at different aspects like:
- **Actor-Critic**
- **Distributed distributional deep deterministic policy gradients (D4PG) algorithm**
- **Model architectures**
- **Hayperparameters**
- **Future Work**
